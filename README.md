## 1. Description
This project is about estimating users car value on market. Project startet with my interest in BMW 140i which is pretty unsulal car these days.
The point is that the prices where not consistant so it was really hard to estimate its market value. I came up with idea to reagularly scrape car advertising portal and make database out of scraped soup.
I started wit beautifullSoup tutorials and than managed to scraped and save everything I wanted to SQLite database. Every offer came with its own id so every record in DB stayed unique.
